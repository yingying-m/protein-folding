This repository contains the source code and data used in the BSc Computer Science bachelor project "Dijkstra's Algorithm and Beam Search for Protein Folding Using the 2D HP Model" by Ying Ying Ma.

The datasets in the "vanEck1000" and "vanEck250" folders were generously provided by Okke van Eck. The dataset "benchmark.csv" is a set of 9 sequences  which are widely used in literature to test protein folding algorithms using the HP model.
